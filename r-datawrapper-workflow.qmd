## Datawrapper workflow

This document represents an attempt to define a workflow for batch-creating Datawrapper charts and maps directly from data sets in an R environment. The ultimate goal would be to create a final pre-publishing step for RMarkdown and Quarto web publishing workflows to include better web-ready visualizations than what can be produced with R's built in tools and packages like ggplot and map-viewer.

```{r}
1 + 1
```
